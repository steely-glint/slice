Lightweight Java 8 minimal STUN/TURN/Ice stack for webRTC
The goal is to provide infrastructure for data channel set up on massive server-side
systems. Also suitable for IoT endpoints due to minimal thread use.
Aims to Support Direct UDP and TURN TLS Only.
(Currently only STUN and HOST - TURN later...)
Loosely based on ORTC ICETransport API

com.ipseorama.slice.Slice is a minimal demo program.
